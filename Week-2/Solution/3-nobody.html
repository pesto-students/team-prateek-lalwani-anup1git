  <h1>Poem: I'm Nobody!</h1>

  <!-- First stanza -->
  <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
    Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>

  <!-- Second stanza -->
  <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
    How public - like a Frog -<br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
    To an admiring Bog!</p>

  <!-- Author and date -->
  <p><cite>By Emily Dickinson (Year)</cite></p>
