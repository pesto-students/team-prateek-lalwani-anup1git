What Does Protocol Stack Mean?
A protocol stack refers to a group of protocols that are runnning concurrently that are employed for the implementation of network protocol suite.

The protocols in a stack determine the interconnectivity rules for a layered network model such as in the OSI or TCP/IP models. To become a stack the protocols must be interoperable being able to connect both vertically between the layers of the network and horizontally between the end-points of each transmission segment.

Application layer HTTP, TLS, DNS
Transport Layer : TCP, UDP
Network Layer: IP ( v4, v6 )
Link Layer: ( Ethernet Wireless LAN )
