What Does Protocol Stack Mean?
A protocol stack refers to a group of protocols that are runnning concurrently that are employed for the implementation of network protocol suite.

The protocols in a stack determine the interconnectivity rules for a layered network model such as in the OSI or TCP/IP models. To become a stack the protocols must be interoperable being able to connect both vertically between the layers of the network and horizontally between the end-points of each transmission segment.

Application layer HTTP, TLS, DNS
Transport Layer : TCP, UDP
Network Layer: IP ( v4, v6 )
Link Layer: ( Ethernet Wireless LAN )

## What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

There are several types of web servers, including Apache, Nginx, IIS, Lighttpd, and Node.js. They differ in terms of performance, features, and architecture. Apache is known for its flexibility and robustness, Nginx is lightweight and efficient, IIS integrates well with Windows, Lighttpd is designed for speed and efficiency, and Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution. Factors affecting performance include concurrency handling, memory usage, and request processing. Choose a web server based on your specific needs.
